**Rock, Paper, Scissors!**


This is a classic game that almost everyone knows since we're little. 

It is a digitalised version based on decision making . By clicking the buttons players chooses, to compare with the random computer results, there will be scores recorded on the website. It is one of the simplest rule that children can also play.

I was inspired by Code Institute's unit "Scope" which was presented by Matt Rudge. I watched the video and got the ideas of how to draw up this  simple game online, to make a similar one.


**Features**

**Existing features**

- Header
	- The title of the game;
	- Under there lists a message to the player "Let's play"
    ![Main]
- The Game options
	- User can choose from the 3 buttons on the page "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissor" to start the game.
	- When user clicks on one button, and computer will also randomly choose one, then the results shows on the page, the scores will be updated when there's a win and lose, if it's a draw, then no scores will be updated.
    - There's a RESTART button under the picture, which can clean up the already recorded scores.
- The Footer
	- Only a sentence to encourage the user to come back and play sometime.


**Testing:**
- I tested playing this game in Chrome;
- I confirmed that game results are correct all the time;
- I confirmed page is responsive;


**Bugs**
- When I tested my code in gitpod, in the preview, when I click the button , the picture doesn't shown properly, but it worked on my VS code.
- I have checked with my tutor Alan on CI, and discovered:
	- In JavaScript, where I should call my pictures, the initial letter should be lowercase, instead they were in uppercase. 

**Validator Testing:**
- HTML
	- No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator;
- CSS
	- No errors were found when passing through the official Jigsaw validator

**Deployment**
- The site was deployed to GitHub pages, the steps to deploy as follows:
	- In the GitHub repository, click on Settings button;
	- Scrolling down and from the source section, click drop-down menu, select the Master Branch;
    - Once the master branch has been selected, the page provided a link to the finished website.

**Credits**

**Coontent**
- The whole idea was similar to the Code Insitute Unit "Scope", Matt Rudge has walked us through with us for his code, and I was inspired by that.
